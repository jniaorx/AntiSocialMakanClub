# AntiSocialMakanClub
An app made for students in NUS to find people to dine with based on their preferences.

Proposed Level of Achievement: Apollo 11

App Description: 
AntiSocialMakanClub is an app catered to NUS students to find a meal buddy to dine together at a NUS canteen of their choice. Users can make a request indicating their day and time preference to be submitted to the app for matching. Canteen and spoken language preferences are optional and may be indicated during the request creation process as well.

Motivation: 
The motivation behind the creation of AntiSocialMakanClub stems from the challenges NUSâ€™ students face in coordinating meal times when their friend group has conflicting schedules. This could be attributed to the fact that friend groups are often made up of individuals with different majors.

This app aims to address feelings of isolation and loneliness if one were to dine alone. It offers opportunities for users to broaden their social circles and step out of their comfort zones. By meeting new people from diverse backgrounds, the app helps foster a sense of belonging as a NUS student.

Vision:
AntiSocialMakanClub aims to promote a vibrant and inclusive campus culture, where students are able to forge meaningful bonds beyond their immediate circles. This facilitates the sharing of information and insights across various divides, including academic disciplines and residential arrangements.
